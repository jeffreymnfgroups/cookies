                  Hi there! I&apos;m Megan, your local cookie baker and
                  decorator extraordinaire, and owner of Rose &amp; Sugar. Born
                  and raised in the Sacramento area, I&apos;m excited to share
                  my passion with our community and create thoughtful and
                  beautiful cookies for your life&apos;s special occasions.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have always had a love for creating, whether through arts
                  and crafts or baking. It wasn&apos;t until the year 2020 that
                  I stumbled upon the art of cookie decorating &amp; the rest
                  was history! Just like many others during the pandemic, I
                  embraced this newfound hobby of decorating, as it truly gave
                  me a creative outlet and ease of anxiety I was looking for. I
                  always say, you don&apos;t choose the cookie life, the cookie
                  life chooses youâ€¦ and it sure did!
                </p>

                <p>
                  What started as a hobby baking for friends and family has
                  blossomed into a small business, I am so proud of today! Now
                  after almost five years of decorating, I&apos;ve decided to
                  share my passion not just through custom orders, but also by
                  teaching others. There&apos;s something magical about watching
                  people discover their own creativity while decorating cookies
                  in my small-group classes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Each Rose &amp; Sugar cookie is handcrafted with love,
                  attention to detail, and a touch of whimsy. Whether I&apos;m
                  creating a custom set for your baby shower or guiding you
                  through your first piping technique, my goal is always the
                  same &mdash; to bring a little extra sweetness and beauty to
                  your day. Thank you for trusting me and letting me be a part
                  of celebrating your special moments!
                </p>
